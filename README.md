## Synopsis & Acknowledgements
<ul><li>Within this repository you will find the latest version and updates to PrusaSlicer 2.6+ and AnkerMake (alpha) Slicer profiles created by <a href="https://github.com/TheMasterOfTech">@TheMasterOfTech</a>. In collaboration behind the scenes with <a href="https://github.com/just-trey">@just-trey</a>, some of my settings from my profiles may be found within his <a href="https://github.com/Ankermgmt/prusaslicer-ankermake-ce-profiles">PrusaSlicer 2.6+ AnkerMake M5 Community Profiles</a> as we continue to work diligently in exchanging ideas to improve the prints of the AnkerMake community! My profiles would not be possible without the initial skeleton profile of work from <a href="https://github.com/just-trey">@just-trey</a>. Thank you Trey for giving many users a base to help dial in their slicer settings for their printer(s) over the coarse of their ownership. Let's keep making everyone!</li><li>Thank you to <a href="https://github.com/luka6000">@luka6000</a> for providing the Color Swap G-Code. To learn more on how to use the Color Swap G-Code in both PrusaSlicer 2.6+ and/or AnkerMake (alpha) Slicer, please <a href="https://wiki.printed.boats/en/Tips/Color-swap-with-Prusa">click here</a>.</ul>

## üíª Installing the Profiles
<ol>
  <li>Download the latest release of my profiles (should be saved to your downloads folder by default)</li>
  <li>Open the latest version variant of PrusaSlicer 2.6.0. Latest version of PrusaSlicer 2.6.0 is listed <a href="https://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/releases">here</a>.</li>
  <li>In the menubar at the top of your screen while PrusaSlicer is open, click <b><i>File</b></i> ‚û°Ô∏è <b><i>Import</b></i> ‚û°Ô∏è <b><i>Import Config Bundle</b></i> and then select the file in which you downloaded that contains my profiles. Click <b><i>open</b></i>. You're done! Happy printing!</li>
</ol>

## ‚ö†Ô∏è ADVISORIES
<ul><li>These profiles are <b>ONLY</b> for use with PrusaSlicer 2.6+ or AnkerMake (alpha) Slicer. These profiles are <b>NOT</b> compatible with Cura or any other non-Prusa engine based slicers. As I only utilize PrusaSlicer, I will <b>NOT</b> be establishing profiles for Cura or other slicers unless stated otherwise.</li>
<li>If you are a Cura user and would like profiles for your M5 for that slicer, please download and install <a href="https://github.com/Ankermgmt/prusaslicer-ankermake-ce-profiles">Cura 5.1+ AnkerMake M5 Community Profiles</a> developed and maintained by <a href="https://github.com/just-trey">@just-trey</a>.</li><li>While I strive to provide profiles that give you exceptional results, I am in strong belief that there is never <i>universal</i> profiles. Once users become familiar with their printer along with all the different settings possible to change within their slicer, it is strongly encouraged for users to learn and tune their slicer settings to satisfy their needs.</li></ul>

## üêû KNOWN ISSUES
<ul><li>The speed multiplier (ex x1.8) displayed on the touchscreen display of the AnkerMake M5 does not reflect correctly (<a href="https://github.com/ankermake">@AnkerMake</a> has confirmed that this will be changed to display the actual speed in realtime as opposed to a multiplier in a future firmware update. ETA unknown.).</ul>
