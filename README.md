## Synopsis & Acknowledgements
Within this repository you will find the latest version and updates to AnkerMake M5 slicer profiles developed and maintained by @TheMasterOfTech. In collaboration behind the scenes with @just-trey, some of my settings from my profiles may be found within his <a href="https://github.com/Ankermgmt/prusaslicer-ankermake-ce-profiles">AnkerMake-CE Profiles</a> as we continue to work diligently in exchanging ideas to improve the prints of the AnkerMake community! My profiles would not be possible without the initial skeleton profile of work from @just-trey. Thank you Trey for giving many users a base to help dial in their slicer settings for their printer(s) over the coarse of their ownership. Let's keep making everyone!
